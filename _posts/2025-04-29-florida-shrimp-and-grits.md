## A Southern Staple with a Florida Twist

Shrimp and grits is a classic Southern comfort food, but in Florida, it's all about the fresh Gulf shrimp. This dish features creamy, buttery grits topped with sautéed shrimp in a flavorful sauce—perfect for breakfast, brunch, or dinner.

## Shrimp and Grits Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1 pound large Florida shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 cup stone-ground grits
- 4 cups water or chicken broth

- 1/2 cup diced bell pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper, to taste
