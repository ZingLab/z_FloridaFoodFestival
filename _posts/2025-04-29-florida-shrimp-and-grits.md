# Florida Shrimp and Grits

## A Southern Staple with a Florida Twist

Shrimp and grits is a classic Southern comfort food, but in Florida, it's all about the fresh Gulf shrimp. This dish features creamy, buttery grits topped with sautéed shrimp in a flavorful sauce—perfect for breakfast, brunch, or dinner.

## Shrimp and Grits Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1 pound large Florida shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 cup stone-ground grits
- 4 cups water or chicken broth
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup chopped scallions
- 1/2 cup diced bell pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Cook the grits**: Bring water or broth to a boil. Stir in grits, reduce heat, and simmer until thick and creamy (about 20-25 minutes). Stir in cheese and half the butter.

3. **Assemble**: Spoon grits into bowls. Top with shrimp and sauce. Serve with lemon wedges.
