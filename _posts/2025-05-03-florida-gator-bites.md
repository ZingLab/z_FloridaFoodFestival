# Florida Gator Bites

## A Taste of the Wild

Alligator is a true Florida delicacy, especially in the Everglades region. Gator tail meat is lean, tender, and mild—perfect for frying into crispy bites. Served with a zesty dipping sauce, these are a must-try for adventurous eaters!

## Gator Bites Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1 pound alligator tail meat, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cornmeal
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Vegetable oil, for frying

#### For the Dipping Sauce:
