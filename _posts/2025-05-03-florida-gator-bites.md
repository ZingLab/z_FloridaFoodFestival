# Florida Gator Bites

## A Taste of the Wild

Alligator is a true Florida delicacy, especially in the Everglades region. Gator tail meat is lean, tender, and mild—perfect for frying into crispy bites. Served with a zesty dipping sauce, these are a must-try for adventurous eaters!

## Gator Bites Recipe
