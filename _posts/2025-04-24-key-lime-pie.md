# Classic Key Lime Pie

## The Sunshine State's Signature Sweet

No dessert captures the spirit of Florida quite like Key lime pie. Born in the Florida Keys, this iconic treat is beloved for its perfect balance of tart and sweet, creamy and crisp. The story of Key lime pie is woven into the fabric of Florida's culinary history, with roots stretching back to the late 19th century when sponge fishermen and local cooks first combined condensed milk, egg yolks, and the tiny, aromatic Key limes native to the region.

Key limes, smaller and more fragrant than their Persian cousins, give this pie its signature tang. Traditionally, the pie was made without baking, relying on the chemical reaction between the lime juice and condensed milk to "set" the filling. Today, a quick bake ensures food safety and a perfectly smooth texture.

Whether enjoyed after a day on the water or as the sweet finale to a backyard barbecue, Key lime pie is a Florida classic that brings a taste of the tropics to any table.

## Classic Key Lime Pie Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 12 full crackers)
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 3 large egg yolks
- 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 cup fresh Key lime juice (or regular lime juice if unavailable)
- 1 tablespoon lime zest
- Whipped cream, for topping
- Thin lime slices or zest, for garnish

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the crust**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan.

2. **Bake the crust**: Bake for 8-10 minutes, until lightly golden. Remove from oven and let cool slightly.

3. **Make the filling**: In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and lime zest until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add sweetened condensed milk and whisk until smooth. Slowly whisk in the Key lime juice until fully combined.

4. **Fill and bake**: Pour the filling into the cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes, until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.

5. **Cool and chill**: Let the pie cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours (or overnight) until fully chilled.

6. **Serve**: Top with whipped cream and garnish with lime slices or zest. Slice and enjoy!

## Variations

### Coconut Key Lime Pie
- Add 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut to the crust mixture for a tropical twist.
- Sprinkle toasted coconut on top before serving.

### Frozen Key Lime Pie
- After chilling, freeze the pie for 2-3 hours for a refreshing frozen treat.
- Serve straight from the freezer on hot Florida days.

## Serving Suggestions

Key lime pie is best served cold, making it the perfect dessert for Florida's warm climate. Pair it with:
- Fresh berries
- Iced tea or a mojito
- A sunset view, if you can find one!

Enjoy a slice of Florida sunshine with every bite!
