# Florida Guava Pastries (Pastelitos de Guayaba)

## Miami's Beloved Breakfast Pastry

Pastelitos de guayaba are a staple in Miami's Cuban bakeries. These flaky pastries, filled with sweet guava paste and sometimes cream cheese, are enjoyed for breakfast or as a snack with strong Cuban coffee. They're easy to make at home with store-bought puff pastry.

## Guava Pastries Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1 package (2 sheets) frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1/2 cup guava paste, sliced
- 4 ounces cream cheese, sliced (optional)
- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
- 2 tablespoons sugar (for sprinkling)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare pastry**: Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut each pastry sheet into 6 squares.

2. **Fill**: Place a slice of guava paste (and cream cheese, if using) in the center of each square. Fold over to form rectangles; seal edges with a fork.

3. **Bake**: Place on a baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake 15-18 minutes, until golden and puffed.

4. **Serve**: Cool slightly before serving. Enjoy with coffee!

## Variations

- Use only guava paste for a traditional version.
- Add a dusting of powdered sugar after baking.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve warm with Cuban coffee or café con leche.
