# Classic Cuban Sandwich

## A Taste of Tampa's Heritage

The Cuban sandwich, or "Cubano," is a Florida legend, especially in Tampa and Miami. This hearty, pressed sandwich reflects the region's rich immigrant history, blending Cuban, Spanish, and Italian influences. The result is a savory masterpiece: crusty Cuban bread filled with roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and yellow mustard, then pressed until hot and crisp.

## Cuban Sandwich Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1 loaf Cuban bread (or substitute French bread)
- 4 tablespoons yellow mustard
- 8 ounces sliced roast pork
- 8 ounces sliced ham
- 8 ounces Swiss cheese
- 8-10 dill pickle slices
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened

### Instructions:

1. **Assemble the sandwich**: Slice the bread lengthwise. Spread mustard on both halves. Layer with roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles.

2. **Press and grill**: Close the sandwich and spread butter on the outside. Grill in a sandwich press or skillet over medium heat, pressing down, until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted (about 5-7 minutes per side).

3. **Serve**: Slice and enjoy hot!

## Variations

- Add salami for the "Tampa style" Cuban.
- Substitute turkey for a lighter version.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve with plantain chips and a cold soda for a true Florida lunch.
