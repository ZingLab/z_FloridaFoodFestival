# Florida Grouper Sandwich

## The Gulf Coast Classic

No Florida beach trip is complete without a grouper sandwich. This beloved dish features a flaky, mild grouper fillet—fried, grilled, or blackened—served on a soft bun with crisp lettuce, tomato, and a dollop of tartar sauce. It's a staple at waterfront shacks and upscale restaurants alike, capturing the laid-back spirit of the Sunshine State.

## Grouper Sandwich Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 4 grouper fillets (about 6 ounces each)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the fillets**: Pat the grouper dry. Season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay.

2. **Bread the fish**: Dredge each fillet in flour, dip in egg, then coat with panko.

3. **Fry**: Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high. Fry fillets 3-4 minutes per side, until golden and cooked through.

5. **Serve**: Enjoy hot, preferably with a view of the Gulf!
