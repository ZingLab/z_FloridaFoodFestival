# Florida Keys Conch Fritters

## A Bite of the Islands

Conch fritters are a beloved snack in the Florida Keys, blending tender conch meat with peppers, onions, and spices, then frying to golden perfection. Served with a tangy dipping sauce, they're a taste of island life in every bite.

## Conch Fritters Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup cooked conch meat, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup bell pepper, finely chopped

#### For the Dipping Sauce:
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
