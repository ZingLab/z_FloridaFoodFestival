# Florida Stone Crab Claws with Mustard Sauce

## A Treasure from Florida's Waters

Stone crab season is a much-anticipated event along Florida's Gulf Coast. These prized claws are celebrated for their sweet, tender meat and sustainable harvesting practicesâ€”only the claws are taken, and the crabs are returned to the sea to regenerate. Enjoyed in seafood shacks and fine restaurants alike, stone crab claws are a true Florida delicacy, best served chilled with a zesty mustard sauce.

## Stone Crab Claws Recipe
